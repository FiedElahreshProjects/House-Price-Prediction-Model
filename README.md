![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01baea68-8691-479d-9fb9-f8be22b121d9)

This project aims to predict housing prices using California housing data. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor to achieve a robust prediction.

---

## Project Overview

**This project uses:**
+ Python and libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
+ scikit-learn for preprocessing, splitting datasets, and applying machine learning algorithms.
+ The primary goal is to predict median house values based on various features like location, room count, and income.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project includes the following features:
- `longitude` and `latitude` (location data)  
- `housing_median_age`  
- `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`  
- `population`, `households`  
- `median_income`  
- `median_house_value` (target variable)  
- `ocean_proximity` (categorical feature)  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This was made possible using the [California Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)

## **Project Workflow**
### 1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
- Imported the dataset using `pandas`.
- Checked for missing values and dropped rows with null values in the `total_bedrooms` column.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Applied logarithmic transformation to skewed columns like `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`, `population`, and `households` to normalize distributions.
- Created new features:
  - `bedroom_ratio` = `total_bedrooms / total_rooms`
  - `household_rooms` = `total_rooms / households`
- Encoded the categorical feature `ocean_proximity` using one-hot encoding.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
- Used **histograms** to analyze feature distributions.  
- Correlation heatmaps (`sns.heatmap`) to understand relationships between features.  
- Scatter plots to analyze the effect of `latitude` and `longitude` on `median_house_value`.

### 4. **Model Training**
- **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor** were applied:
   - `StandardScaler` was used to standardize numerical features.  
   - Random Forest achieved a performance score of **0.82** on the test data.
